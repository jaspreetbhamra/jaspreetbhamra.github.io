## Implementation Details

### Feature 1: Authentication

Describe how you implemented this feature, including code examples:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
}

async function authenticateUser(credentials: Credentials): Promise<User> {
  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(credentials),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Authentication failed');
  }

  return response.json();
}
```

### Feature 2: Real-time Updates

Explain another key feature with relevant details.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Initial load time was too slow for mobile devices.

**Solution**: Implemented code splitting and lazy loading, reducing initial bundle size by 60%.

```javascript
// Before
import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent';

// After
const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
```

### Challenge 2: State Management

**Problem**: State was becoming difficult to manage across many components.

**Solution**: Introduced a centralized state management solution with clear data flow.

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Add project metadata
Add to `src/data/projects.ts`:
```typescript
{
  id: "your-project-id",
  title: "Your Project Title",
  description: "Brief description...",
  tags: ["React", "TypeScript"],
  date: "2024-03-15",
  status: "completed",
  link: "https://github.com/username/project",
  hasDetailPage: true,
}
```

### Step 2: Create MDX file (Optional)
Only if you want a detail page:
1. Copy this template to `/content/projects/your-project-id.mdx`
2. Update frontmatter to match your project
3. Customize the content

### Step 3: Add assets
Place images in `/public/assets/projects/your-project-id/`

**Note**: If you only want to link to GitHub/external URL without a detail page:
- Set `hasDetailPage: false` in projects.ts
- Add `link` field with external URL
- Skip creating the MDX file
