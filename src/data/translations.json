I'm Jay!\n(Or Jaspreet if we’re being formal :-D )\n\n🧠 I’m a Data Scientist / ML Engineer with 5+ years of experience wrangling data, building models, and figuring out how to make machines a little smarter\n📊 I love using data to tell stories — the kind that make people go “wait… what?”\n💻 I love programming! There’s just something deeply satisfying about building things from scratch — it feels like digital magic\n🎨 I’m also pretty artsy. I sketch, draw, and paint (sometimes all at once, lol) — my latest side project has been attempting wood carving to carve an Evee, haha\n🎶 Music = life. I sing, play guitar, dabble in Indian classical music, and have recently started learning drums and experimenting with Ableton (aka “me vs Ableton: the saga”)\n\nThis site is a mix of all the things I love — science, creativity, curiosity, and a lot of chaos. Welcome to my corner of the internet 🌍\n\nThank you for stopping by! I hope you find something here that makes you smile, think, or hum a tune, or even better, all three at once.",
