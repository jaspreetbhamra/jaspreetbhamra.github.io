*(Or Jaspreet if we’re being formal :-D )*

- 🧠 I’m a **Data Scientist / ML Engineer** with 5+ years of experience wrangling data, building models, and figuring out how to make machines a little smarter
- 📊 I love using data to tell stories — the kind that make people go “wait… *what?*”
- 💻 I love programming! There’s just something deeply satisfying about building things from scratch — it feels like digital magic
- 🎨 I’m also pretty artsy. I sketch, draw, and paint (sometimes all at once, lol) — my latest side project has been attempting wood carving to carve an Evee, haha
- 🎶 **Music = life.** I sing, play guitar, dabble in Indian classical music, and have recently started learning drums and experimenting with Ableton (aka “me vs Ableton: the saga”)

> This site is a mix of all the things I love — science, creativity, curiosity, and a lot of chaos. Welcome to my corner of the internet 🌍

Thank you for stopping by!  I hope you find something here that makes you smile, think, or hum a tune.
